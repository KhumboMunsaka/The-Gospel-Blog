          <section><h2>What is meant by this?</h2>
          
          <p> Is your objection to this something like "If Jesus is God, was
                he praying to himself?"; The good news is that you haven't even
                began to understand what this statement means.</p>
                <p>In as much as I would want to cover this exhaustively, there is only so much you can do in a assignment blog</p>

            <p>What is meant by this can be explained in the opening verse of the Gospel of John. The word is with God but the word is God. You see the Word (Jesus, John 1:14) is with God but he also is God. You simply can't understand this outside of a trinitarian context. He is literally called God. When a Christian says Jesus is God, they are NOT saying that He and the Father are the same person. Rather it is that God exists in three persons.</p>

          <section><h2>Without Him, you wouldn't come to be</h2>
          <p>John 1:3 says that apart from him, nothing would have come into being.
          <p>It says</p>  
             3:Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.
            This excludes him from being created. </p></section>

          <h2> Is Jesus God? — His followers declared Him to be God. </h2>    

 <p> John reiterates the concept of Jesus’ deity: “The Word [Jesus] was God” and “the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14). These verses clearly indicate that Jesus is God in the flesh. Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood? Jesus Christ. And this same verse declares that God purchased His church with His own blood. Therefore, Jesus is God.</p>
 <p> 
Thomas the disciple declared concerning Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28). Jesus does not correct him. Titus 2:13 encourages us to wait for the coming of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ (see also 2 Peter 1:1). In Hebrews 1:8, the Father declares of Jesus, “But about the Son He says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.’” The Father refers to Jesus as God, indicating that Jesus is indeed God. </p>

 <p>  In Revelation, an angel instructed the apostle John to only worship God (Revelation 19:10). Several times in Scripture Jesus receives worship (Matthew 2:11; 14:33; 28:9, 17; Luke 24:52; John 9:38). He never rebukes people for worshiping Him. If Jesus were not God, He would have told people to not worship Him, just as the angel in Revelation did. Beyond these, there are many other passages of Scripture that argue for Jesus being God.</p>
